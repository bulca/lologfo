		<p class="lead">AccountsZone is not affiliated in any way with the shops or their owners. AccountsZone is only a hosting platform for the sellers aimed at making the process of selling accounts easier.</p>
		<p>Shops can be rated after making your first purchase with them. Rating a shop will help other users be able to determine if a shop can be trusted or not. Any abuse of the rating system can result in account termination. As always, deal with your own risk.</p>
		<p>AccountsZone is not responsible if you purchase an account that is dead/isn't working, although we do try our best to make sure this doesn't happen. If you happen to have a problem with a shop and you feel like you were scammed, contact the seller. If that doesn't resolve your issue, open a ticket and we will try our best to resolve it.</p>
